Write a function `secondGreatLow` that takes a single array of numbers and returns the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively, separated by a space. For example: if the array contains [7, 7, 12, 98, 106] the output should be "12 98". The array will not be empty and will contain at least 2 numbers. It can get tricky if there's just two numbers!

Write a function `timeConvert` that takes a number parameter and returns the number of hours and minutes the parameter converts to (ie. if num = 63 then the output should be 1:3). Separate the number of hours and minutes with a colon.
